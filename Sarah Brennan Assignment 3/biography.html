					<p>David Frederick Attenborough was born in Isleworth, West London on 8th May 1926, to father Frederick Attenborough and mother Mary Clegg. He was the middle child with 2 brothers, eldest Richard who became an Academy Award-winning actor and director and youngest John who was an executive at an Italian car manufacturer. He also had 2 foster sisters during World War II who were Jewish refugees. He grew up in Leicester on the University of Leicester campus as his father was the Prinicpal from 1932 - 1951. From an early age Attenborough was interested in collecting rocks, stones and fossils which was surprising for living in a urban area. David was first inspired during a lecture by Grey Owl (a.k.a Archibald Belaney) about his promotion for conservation and saving the beaver.  (<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough" target="_blank">Wikipedia.com, n.d.</a>) This lecture also inspired David’s brother, Richard, to direct a biopic the film<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Owl_(film)" target="_blank"> "Grey Wolf"</a>.</p>

					<p>Attenborough attended  "Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and then won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in 1945, where he studied geology and zoology and obtained a degree in natural sciences." (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough" target="_blank">Wikipedia.com, n.d.</a>)</p>

					<p>He joined the navy once he received his degree to travel the world, however, he was only stationed on a ship in Wales for 2 years. After this he worked in a publishing company editing children’s book and then married Jane Oriel a year later in 1950. (<a href="https://www.biography.com/people/david-attenborough" target="_blank">Biography.com, n.d.</a>) That same year he applied for a position as a broadcaster at the BBC but unfortunately was rejected. However, they kept his CV on file and contacted him about a 3-month training course, where he later was taken on full time. This was the beginning of a long-standing relationship with the BBC and how he became the most well-known broadcaster worldwide. </p>

						<h3>Working at the BBC</h3>

						<p>When he first started working at the BBC, Attenborough encountered a few difficulties to start working in front of the camera as well as behind it. One difficulty he faced was because many homes did not have their own TV’s, so there were very few shows on the natural world, another reason he came up against difficulties was because he had been told his teeth were too big to appear on-air. Despite this Attenborough continued his goal and eventually went on to co-host "The Pattern of Animals" with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Huxley" target="_blank">Sir Julian Huxley</a>.
							
						<p>Attenborough began to resent working on this show, however, as he thought it was too cruel to take animals out of their natural habitat for people’s entertainment and so he went on to create a new show called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Quest" target="_blank">"Zoo Quest"</a> where he filmed animals in captivity and in the wild, from a distance to make sure not disturb how they would interact naturally. This then became the standard of natural documentaries seen today.</p>
							
						<p>In 1960, Attenborough made the decision to leave the BBC to get a postgraduate degree in social anthropology. Eventually, in March of 1965, he returned to the BBC to be the controller of BBC2, which had just been created. Because of his return to the BBC, Attenborough did not finish his postgraduate degree. In 1972, however, he made the decision to resign as controller of BBC2 to continue with his passion of animals and nature.
