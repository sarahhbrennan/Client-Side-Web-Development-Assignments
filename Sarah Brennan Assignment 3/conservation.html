					<p>David Attenborough has always been someone who has looked at the way humans have impacted the world and environment. In the last 15 years, he has become more vocal in telling us how the choices we make in life affect the world and animals around us. In 2006 he joined up with a bird project to help stop the killing of albatross through fishing. He also has helped many organisations in their fight to protect the natural world like <a href="https://www.coolearth.org/">Cool Earth</a>, <a href = "http://www.worldlandtrust.org/">World Land Trust</a>, <a href = "World Wildlife Fund: WWF - Endangered Species Conservation">WWF</a> and <a href = "https://www.populationmatters.org/">Population Matters</a>.</p>
					
					<p>Attenborough also brought to the forefront how the human population is a huge factor for global warming and the extinction of so many animals. The more we grow the less land there is to share. When he first started working with the BBC, the human population was measured at just 2.5 billion people and as of 2016 that amount has tripled to 7.5 billion. In 2015, US President Barack Obama interviewed Attenborough where they discussed our planet and its future, their drive for nature, and what measures can be taken to protect us from destroying Earth.<a href="clips.html#obama"> View Here</a>.</p>
					
					<p>In David Attenborough's most recent show, Blue Planet II, we were shown the incredible new knowledge now known about fish, mammals and birds. We learnt how fish in the deep sea eat, to the lengths and risks animals go to to reproduce and look after their young. However, he also brought to life the negative effects humans have changed the oceans. We were told that over 8 million metric tons of plastic enters the oceans each year, and animals are eating and feeding this to their young. He also showed us how global warming is affecting everything from icebergs to coral reefs and left with a message that if we donâ€™t do something now to help, there will not be any planet for generations to come.</p>
